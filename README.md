LEGEND OF SEEPLUSIA

Welcome to SeePlusia, brave heroine Zeldana!
Our prince, Prince Lazy, has been captured by an evil wizard.
We need your help in rescuing the prince!
To save Prince Lazy, you must travel through the world of SeePlusia and collect
three precious Objectos crystals. Only when you have collected all three can you
travel across the Bridge of Death and to the Wizard's Castle to resuce him.
You have enough food to last you 30 days. If you run out of food, the game is over and you die.
To move through the world, type a direction when prompted.
A valid input is North, South, East, or West.
It's time to begin your quest!
